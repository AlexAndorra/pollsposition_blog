            The PollsPosition project is an open-source endeavor with three main goals:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Exploring new statistical methods and applying them to real-life issues and
                datasets.
                This is a
                way for me to gain
                new skills and stay up to date with the field of Bayesian statistics, where the fun
                part
                is that you're never done
                learning! As such, I like to call PollsPosition my "nerdy sandbox" ü§ì Understanding
                how
                and why people make decisions
                when they don‚Äôt have all the facts is fascinating to me. That‚Äôs why I like, among
                others, electoral forecasting, and I
                use it as a sparring partner.
            </li>
            <li>
                Popularizing and illustrating the power of Bayesian statistics. These are
                especially helpful in
                contexts where data
                are sparse and imprecise, domain knowledge is important, and estimating uncertainty
                is one of the main interest of the
                analysis. Well look at that: democratic elections check all these boxes ‚úÖ Icing on
                the cake, French political parties
                are numerous and change in nature -- compared to the US for instance -- which makes
                the models all the more complicated,
                but also... interesting! If you're curious, I presented a talk in 2020 about a
                version of the model:

            </li>
            <li>
                A last, broader goal is to try to counteract our natural tendencies (especially
                during
                electoral campaigns!) to
                cherry-pick data, overreact to the latest poll, and, most importantly, completely
                misinterpret uncertainties and
                probabilities. I was invited on a podcast in 2020 to talk about just that, if that's
                of interest to you üìª I'm perfectly
                aware that it's a lofty and probably unattainable goal. I do believe that spreading
                the methods of rational and critical
                thinking is essential though, so I can at least try ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ For sure, I can't do it
                alone, so if you like what we do at
                PollsPosition, feel free to share our content with your friends and colleagues -- or
                if you don't like it, share it with
                people you don't like, that works too!

            Alex Andorra. By day, I'm a Bayesian modeler at the PyMC Labs consultancy. By night, I
            don't (yet)
            fight crime, but I'm an open-source enthusiast and core contributor to the awesome
            Python packages PyMC and ArviZ.

            An always-learning statistician, I love building models and studying elections and human
            behavior. I also love Nutella a bit too much, but I don't like talking about it ‚Äì I
            prefer eating it.
