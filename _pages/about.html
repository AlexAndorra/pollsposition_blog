            The PollsPosition project is an
            <a href="https://github.com/AlexAndorra/pollsposition_models"
               target="_blank"
            >open-source
            </a>
            endeavor with three main goals:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Exploring new statistical methods and applying them to real-life issues and
                   datasets</b>. This is a way for me to gain new skills and stay up to date with the
                   field
                of Bayesian statistics, where the fun part is that you're never done learning! As
                such, I like to call PollsPosition my "nerdy sandbox" ü§ì Understanding how and why
                people make decisions when they don‚Äôt have all the facts is fascinating to me.
                That‚Äôs why I like, among others, electoral forecasting, and I use it as a sparring
                partner.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Popularizing and illustrating the power of Bayesian statistics</b>. These are especially
                helpful in contexts where data are sparse and imprecise, domain knowledge is
                important, and estimating uncertainty is one of the main interest of the analysis.
                Well look at that: democratic elections check all these boxes ‚úÖ Icing on the cake,
                French political parties are numerous and change in nature -- compared to the US for
                instance -- which makes the models all the more complicated, but also...
                interesting! If you're curious, I presented a talk in 2020 about a version of the
                model:
                <div class="pt-4 text-center">
                    <iframe width="520" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EYdIzSYwbSw"
                            frameborder="0"
                            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                            allowfullscreen
                    ></iframe>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                A last, broader goal is to try to <b>counteract our natural tendencies</b> (especially
                during electoral campaigns!) <b>to cherry-pick data, overreact to the latest poll,
                                                 and,
                                                most importantly, completely misinterpret uncertainties and probabilities</b>. I was
                invited on a podcast in 2020 to talk about just that, if that's of interest to you
                üìª I'm perfectly aware that it's a lofty and probably unattainable goal. I do
                believe that spreading the methods of rational and critical thinking is essential
                though, so I can at least try ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ For sure, I can't do it alone, so if you like
                what we do at PollsPosition, feel free to share our content with your friends and
                colleagues -- or if you don't like it, share it with people you don't like, that
                works too!

            My name is Alexandre Andorra by the way. By day, I'm a Bayesian modeler at the
            <a href="https://www.pymc-labs.io/" target="_blank">PyMC Labs consultancy</a>
            and host the most popular podcast dedicated to Bayesian inference out there -- aka

            An always-learning statistician, I love building models and studying elections and human
            behavior. I also love Nutella a bit too much, but I don't like talking about it ‚Äì I
            prefer eating it üòã
        </p>
        <p>
            I can't finish without acknowledging the people who help me in this nerdy adventure,
            most notably the brilliant Alexis Berg√®s who devises with me for hours about ways to
            best model elections, as well as the wonderful core-developers of ArviZ and PyMC, who
            often indulge my unrelenting stats questions ü§©

            elections in a row!" -- yeah, I'm a bit sarcastic.
